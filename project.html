        <h1 class="title">Fertility Rate Problem</h1>

        <h3 class="section-title">Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            The aim of the project is to investigate fertility rates around the globe, to see the trends in particular countries, and consider the possible solutions that policymakers can apply to oppose it. Finally, show why it is seen as a problem and debate if it is really the case for every country. 

            In the last 50 years, the global fertility rate has halved. Right now, it is around 2.3 children per woman, however, in many countries, it is much lower than that (Roser, 2014).

        <p>
          Countries with the lowest rate are South Korea, with 0.9 children per woman, Puerto Rico 1 child per woman and then Malta, Singapore, and Hong Kong with 1.1 children per woman (World Population Review, 2023). That low rate arises the first problem for countries: the inability to replace the society naturally, which may result in a rapidly decreasing population level in future years. The graphs and map above clearly show the decreasing trend around the globe. 
The data for first graph is taken from World Bank site using API, the second one uses csv compiled from the “ourworldindata” site.

        <p>
            Developed countries increase the subsidies on families as a way of trying to oppose the decreasing fertility rates (Wise et al., 2022), however, it seems to not be working as intended by policymakers. One example can be the Polish government that introduced an additional cash benefit called “500+” in 2018 (the red vertical line on the graph), the funds were presented as a fast and long-lasting way of improving the fertility rate. However, as seen above the trend is not significantly influenced by the increased expenditure and is not much different than in other countries that did not introduce such benefits. These findings are also consistent with Bernice Kuang from the University of Southampton that stated explicitly that pronatalist policies do not consistently change the fertility rate (Wise et al., 2022)

                      The data for the third graph uses API from World Bank and the fourth one uses CSV file compiled from two datasets available at stats.oecd site.

        <h3 class="section-title">Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
           The decrease in fertility rate is undeniable and considered an issue for many countries. On top of that the trend seems to be hard to turn around. However, the reasons for that are rather positive, especially for developing countries. The improved healthcare system, empowerment of women (focus on career and increased labour force participation), wide use of contraception, and changes in social and religious norms.   (Roser, 2014)
The fertility rate problem must be tackled much more complexly, the education and encouragement for planned families are key. Open boarders policy for workers or at least making it easier to work for immigrants is one of solving many problems from declining fertility rate. Tomas Sobotka from the Vienna Institute of Demography said that one way of resolving the problem is to introduce more gender equality so that men take longer parental leaves and generally help more in the early stages of parenting allowing women to get back to their careers and education faster. However, he also pointed out that governments should not explicitly incentives women to have more children than they would like, only to meet some national quota or their goal to increase the population (Wise et al., 2022). It shows a bigger and more philosophical issue that should be considered by governments. It encourages us to look at the globe as a whole and see all the pros and cons of the policies

        The data regarding fertility are generally easy to obtain. The second and fourth graph uses API on top of that in the fourth graph I needed to combine the datasets. The hardest one was probably the fifth dataset because I needed to use “transform” to obtain only the “Raise” variables, get rid of empty cells, and use “aggregate”. Considering not many problems with the data I focused on improving the code to make it look clean and as easy to read as possible and making the folders for the project’s charts and data. It allows for easier replication, automation and makes it easier to work further on this topic using the same code.
